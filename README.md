If people are interested in some reading related to the talk:
 
- [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance – Robert Persig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance): A classic story on multiple levels. At its most superficial it is a story about a motorcycle road trip of an man and his son across the USA. At its deepest it is about the train of thought about the essence of things – which started in ancient Greece with Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, through Confucius and Mencius in China and which continues up to the current day in our attempts to create thinking machines (and how all that relates to maintaining a motorbike [aka the real world])
- [Trying Not To Try – Edward Slingerland](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Trying-Not-Try-Science-Spontaneity/dp/0770437613): Contains discussion about conscious and sub-conscious processing and the relationship between the two – and its relationship to Chinese philosophy
- [Blindsight – Peter Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)): A hard (literally and philosophically) science fiction novel which explores what sentience is – and if it has long term survival value against purely subconscious thought processes.
- [Godel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), a Pulitzer-prize winning book on meaning, thought, language, symmetry and mathematics
 
Other useful concepts to Google (other search engines are available):
- [John Searle’s Chinese Room](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/) (think about where the intelligence in the system is – include the recipient of the message)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance
- [Turing’s Halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) (think about how you yourself actually determine when a problem has no solution and compare to how mathematical process cannot do the same – why?)
- Duane Rumbaugh and [Sue Savage Rumbaugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Savage-Rumbaugh)’s work on training apes for semantic understanding – (especially note the training and results of Sherman and Austin vs. those of [Lana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_(chimpanzee)))
